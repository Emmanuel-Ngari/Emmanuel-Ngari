# ðŸ§  Network Analysis Lab
This lab focuses on discovering, scanning, and analyzing hosts across a simulated network using **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **tcpdump**.  
It provides detailed visibility into open ports, services, and vulnerabilities within the internal lab environment.

## ðŸ“‹ Objectives
- Identify live hosts on the subnet.
- Perform full TCP and targeted scans.
- Analyze captured traffic and service banners.
- Document findings and recommendations.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- **Network_Analysis_Report.md** â†’ Comprehensive findings and summary.  
- **reports/** â†’ Contains raw `.txt` outputs (Nmap scans, vulnerability checks, etc.).  
- **screenshots/** â†’ Visual evidence from Wireshark, Nmap, and terminal sessions.

## ðŸ§© Tools Used
- **Nmap** â€” Host discovery, port scanning, service detection.  
- **Wireshark** â€” Deep packet inspection and analysis.  
- **tcpdump** â€” CLI-based packet capture.  

## ðŸ§¾ Summary
This lab validated RDP (3389) exposure and SMB enumeration, revealing potential brute-force and misconfiguration risks.  
Mitigation included access restrictions, NLA enforcement, and firewall tuning.
