# 🧠 Network Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on **network traffic capture, analysis, and threat identification** using tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, and **Nmap**.  
The goal is to understand how data packets flow through a network, identify anomalies, and detect possible malicious patterns.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Capture live network traffic using `tcpdump` and Wireshark.  
- Analyze packet captures (`.pcap` files) for DNS queries, TCP handshakes, and suspicious traffic.  
- Perform host discovery and port scanning using Nmap.  
- Correlate findings to detect potential threats and network misconfigurations.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Wireshark**
- **tcpdump**
- **Nmap**
- **Kali Linux / Ubuntu**
- **NetworkMiner (optional)**

## 📁 Folder Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `screenshots/` | Contains screenshots of network captures and analysis |
| `reports/` | Contains detailed findings and summaries |
| `pcaps/` | Stores packet capture files (`.pcap`) from Wireshark/tcpdump |

---

## 🧾 Example Activities
- Captured DNS and HTTP traffic for real-time monitoring.  
- Detected ARP spoofing attempts in local traffic.  
- Analyzed packet signatures to identify C2 (Command & Control) indicators.  

---

## 🏁 Outcome
Gained practical experience in **network traffic inspection, port scanning, and security anomaly detection**.  
This forms a strong foundation for **incident response and threat hunting** roles.
