## About Me
I’m a dedicated cybersecurity practitioner building hands-on experience in security monitoring, incident response, and network analysis.  
This repository documents my labs, projects, scripts, and reports as I progress toward a professional SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Analyst role.

## Core Focus Areas
- **Security Monitoring & SIEM:** Splunk — log ingestion, SPL searches, dashboards, and detection.
- **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, Nmap — packet capture, protocol analysis, scanning and reconnaissance.
- **Endpoint & OS:** Windows & Linux (Ubuntu, Kali) — log sources, process monitoring, OS artifacts.
- **Incident Response:** Triage, timeline building, containment & reporting.
- **Automation & Scripting:** Python for parsing, alert enrichment and data processing.
- **Tools:** VirtualBox, Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Universal Forwarder, Wireshark, Hydra (ethical testing), Nmap, Suricata/Snort.

3. Keep commits atomic and documented.
