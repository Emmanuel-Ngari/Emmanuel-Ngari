# 🔍 Splunk Labs Project

## 📘 Overview
This project documents my hands-on work with **Splunk** as a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** platform.  
The goal is to collect, analyze, and visualize event logs to identify potential security incidents and improve visibility into system behavior.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Install and configure **Splunk Enterprise** on Windows and Ubuntu.  
- Ingest Windows Event Logs for analysis.  
- Create alerts, dashboards, and correlation searches.  
- Apply **MITRE ATT&CK** mapping for real-world attack simulation.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Splunk Enterprise**
- **Windows 10 Logs**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- **PowerShell**
- **Sysmon**

## 📁 Folder Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `screenshots/` | Contains screenshots of dashboards, alerts, and searches |
| `reports/` | Stores SIEM reports and analysis summaries |
| `logs/` | Contains ingested or sample log files for analysis |

---

## 🧾 Example Activities
- Configured data ingestion for Windows Event Logs.  
- Built detection dashboards for failed login attempts and PowerShell activity.  
- Created custom correlation searches to detect brute-force attempts.  
- Simulated real-time attack patterns using Sysmon logs.
